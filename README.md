# twitter-sentiment-analysis_on_R
Developed an R script to analyze and visualize live tweets using Twitter's API, ggplot2, tidytext, and tm (text mining). 

Given the current coronavirus pandemic, I wanted to know what the public's general sentiment and opinion is on each leader and how well the people think the leader is handling the crisis. 

I selected 3 leaders of countries that seem to be handling the crisis well and 3 leaders from countries where the pandemic is still growing rapidly. I chose the following countries: United States, India, China, Germany, Japan, and Britain and searched for tweets on their leaders: Donald Trump, Narendra Modi, Xi Jinping, Angela Merkel, Shinzo Abe, Boris Johnson. 

Please refer to the powerpoint and R code attached to understand data processing conducted and visualizations.
